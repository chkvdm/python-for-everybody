# Python For Everybody specialization.

This Specialization will introduce fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language. Youâ€™ll use the technologies learned throughout the Specialization to design and create your own  applications for data retrieval, processing, and visualization.

## The specialization includes five courses:

1. Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)
2. <code>[Python Data Structure](https://github.com/chkvdm/PythonForEverybody/tree/main/PythonDataStructure)</code>
3. <code>[Using Python to Access Web Data](https://github.com/chkvdm/PythonForEverybody/tree/main/UsingPythontoAccessWebData)</code>
4. <code>[Using Databases with Python](https://github.com/chkvdm/PythonForEverybody/tree/main/UsingDatabasesWithPython/Week2)</code>
5. Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python
