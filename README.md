# Python For Everybody specialization.

This Specialization will introduce fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language. Youâ€™ll use the technologies learned throughout the Specialization to design and create your own  applications for data retrieval, processing, and visualization.

## The specialization includes five courses:

1. <code>[Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)]()</code>
2. <code>[Python Data Structure](https://github.com/chkvdm/PythonForEverybody/tree/main/PythonDataStructure)</code>
3. <code>[Using Python to Access Web Data][3](https://github.com/chkvdm/PythonForEverybody/tree/main/UsingPythontoAccessWebData)</code>
4. <code>[Using Databases with Python][4]()</code>
5. <code>[Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python]()</code>

All the sections of the list are clickable and contain links to my solutions to the assignments of the Python For Everybody specialization.
