In this assignment you will write a Python program similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/urllink2.py. The program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below, and parse the data, extracting numbers and compute the sum of the numbers in the file. The file is a table of names and comment counts. You are to find all the < span> tags in the file and pull out the numbers from the tag and sum the numbers.
